# Overview

Hi my name is Caden Baird and I'm an aspiring Software Engineer who would like to further develop my problem-solving skills through learning new coding languages, and tackling new projects.

The software that I wrote to develop my skills in the Java language was a basic tic-tac-toe game.

My purpose for writing this project was to learn about Java's syntax and learn more about conditionals, loops, expressions, etc.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to create this software was Visual Studio Code. I also used supplementary resources when needed such as Stack Overflow and ChatGPT.

A couple libraries that were implemented in my code were:

- java.util.ArrayList (Used to create arrays to store user and cpu positions.)
- java.util.Arrays (Used to convert arrays to lists.)
  -java.util.List (Used to represent the rows columns and diagonals on the game board. )
- java.util.Random (Used to generate random numbers for the CPU's position.)
- java.util.Scanner (Used to read input from user.)

# Future Work

A list to fix, improve and add in the future:

- When the user ties with the CPU, the console doesn't print that there was a tie, and the program does not exit.
- Add artificial intelligence to the CPU's choices on where they want to go.
- Make the board bigger.
